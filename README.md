# Sidewalk-Sale

# <Your-Project-Title>

## Welcome to Sidewalk Sale! 

We created a web application that caters to those who are looking for good deals in their neighborhood. Inspired by the stooping phenomenon in Brooklyn,
we were able to digitize the process of looking for a good sidewalk sale. 

- Users can view, post, and save items that are listed in their neighborhood
- Grabbing the geolocation from the users IP address, with their permission, the home page will render a list of items that are available in their neighborgood
- Streamlines the process of endless hours driving around your neighborhood looking for a good find
- Users can contact the seller via javaMailSender about their item
- We know that gathering User's information can feel invasive: We've provided extra security measures by implementing Spring Security. 
- Gives new life to items that would otherwise be discarded

<h3>Geo Location</h3>
** GeoLite 2 3.0.1 requires Java 11 to compile <br>
In GeoIPService, replace the file path with your Geolite download path <br>

<h3>JavaMailSender</h3>
This is only compatiable with GMAIL

In applicaiton.properties you'll need to add this snippet: <br>

spring.mail.host=smtp.gmail.com <br>
spring.mail.port=587 <br>
spring.mail.username= << YOUR GMAIL ADDRESS >> <br>
spring.mail.password= << YOUR GMAIL PASSWORD >> <br>
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=true <br>
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true <br>

You may want to generate an app password from Google: <br>

<h3>Spring boot file upload</h3>
Add a static folder called image <br>
Each item you create will store an image. In your model, the file path will be generated by the path set in photosImagePath <br>
You'll see the correct file path printed in the console
